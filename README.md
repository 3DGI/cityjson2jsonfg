# CityJSON to JSON-FG

*A command line tool for converting CityJSON files to JSON-FG format.*

*JSON-FG* stands for [*OGC Features and Geometries JSON*](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-feat-geo-json), which is (currently) a candidate standard.
JSON-FG extends GeoJSON to support a wider range of use cases.
For *cityjson2jsonfg* the most important capability of JSON-FG is 3D data storage, since [CityJSON](https://www.cityjson.org/) is a 3D spatial data format.
CityJSON is a JSON-based encoding for storing 3D city models, also called digital maquettes or digital twins.

Supported versions:

- CityJSON: 1.1
- JSON-FG: 0.1

## Installation

Required python: >= 3.8

Additionally, you need a relatively new version of `pip` and `setuptools` that supports building from `pyproject.toml` files.

You can install *cityjson2jsonfg* with pip.

```shell
pip install cityjson2jsonfg
```

## Usage

Convert a single CityJSON file to JSON-FG.

```shell
cityjson2jsonfg <input.city.json> <output.jsonfg>
```

See the help menu and the tool version

```shell
cityjson2jsonfg --help
cityjson2jsonfg --version
```

### Pipe from cjio

[cjio]() is a CLI tool for manipulating 3D city models that are stored in CityJSON files.
You can pipe cjio's output directly into *cityjson2jsonfg* without saving an intermedate file.
This is particularly useful if you want to modify the citymodel before the conversion.
For instance, upgrade the CityJSON file to v1.1 and then convert it to JSON-FG.

```shell
cjio --suppress_msg <input.city.json> upgrade save stdout | cityjson2jsonfg - <output.jsonfg>
```

## Limitations

Version 1.0 was primarily developed to convert CityJSON files of the Dutch [3D BAG](https://3dbag.nl/en/viewer) and [3D Basisvoorziening](https://www.pdok.nl/introductie/-/article/3d-basisvoorziening-1) data sets.
Conversion from other data sets might not work.

## Converted data

A subset of the 3D BAG and 3D Basisvoorziening is available at [https://data.3dgi.xyz/jsonfg](https://data.3dgi.xyz/jsonfg).
Both the source and converted files are provided.

## CityJSON --> JSON-FG conversion table

Not all the information contained in a CityJSON document can be represented by JSON-FG.
Therefore, some information can be lost in the conversion.
Below is a mapping of the CityJSON concepts to JSON-FG as it is implemented in *cityjson2jsonfg*.
